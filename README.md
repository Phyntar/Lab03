2: Overflow Occurs at n=256 overflow can be detected my making sure the sum is never negative
3: Overflow occurs at n=65,536 overflow can be detected my making sure the sum is never negative
4: Overflow does not occur it instead starts returning "inf" at 35
5: Overflow does not occur it instead starts returning "inf" at 171
6: while 1/n will continue to grow, it grows so slowly the input would become too large to input before the output overflows
7: the numeric error is that it prints out 4.4 instead of stopping at 4.4 because 4.4 is not < 4.4 because floats save numbers differently
8: If the float is replaced with a double, it correctly stops at 4.2
